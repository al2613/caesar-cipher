# caesar-cipher

Ceasar's Cipher demonstrates one of the oldest methods of encryption How it works is every letter of the message is shifted by a specific amount and replaced by another letter in the alphabet. ROT13 is one of the most common methods of encryption, where it basically means rotate everything forward by 13. Please don't use this as an actual encryption method though :) 

Goals of this cypher:
1. Using string.charCodeAt () method to return a number for each character in the encrypted message string
2. Learning to work with the ASCII character set which maps specific numbers fo characters. Note that upper case and lowercase letters have different values. You can read more here: http://www.asciitable.com/
3. Working with String.fromCharCode to return the character from the ASCII number
